# Constructors
Initialize project Constructors in IDE IntelliJ

This program uses an ArrayList and adds to it created objects of Olive class. The objective of this
program was to use constructors of a class to create objects and pass arguments to the constructor. There
are two classes one being Olive class which has a parameter constructor,  setter/getters for the instant
members such as name, color, and oil. The other class OlivePress will print the name and then call a crush
method that will return the value of oil of the Olive class object.
